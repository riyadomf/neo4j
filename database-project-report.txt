Graph Database Suggestion:
Given the nature of the data and its graph-like structure, I'm choosing Neo4j as the database for storing and querying. It has really good visualization options and also supports indexing for efficient queries.


Data Structure: 
For the provided data structure, we have one type of node: Category. Each category can have multiple child categories, forming a directed edge from the category node to its child category node.
Nodes: Represent categories.
Edges: Represent the parent-child relationship between two category.



Indexing and Visualization
I'll be using the Neo4j query language, Cypher, to achieve the specified goals. Indexing is crucial for efficient querying in a graph database. I need to ensure that properties used for querying, such as category names, are indexed for faster lookups.
I'll be using Neo4j visualization tools to generate visual representations of the graph.

# Import the CSV into the database:
Initially, I tried to import using LOAD CSV and Periodic commit but It was taking too much time.
That's why I used neo4j-admin import tool.

At first I preprocessed the taxonomy.csv file by removing all the escaped quotations (\"). 
Then I created a csv file with distinct nodes named category_nodes.csv from the taxonomy_preprocessed.csv file.

Then I imported both the taxonomy_preprocessed.csv and category_nodes.csv and ran the neo4j-admin import command as below.

bin/neo4j-admin database import full taxonomy 
    --nodes "<file/path/of/category_nodes.csv>" 
    --relationships "<file/path/of/taxonomy_preprocessed.csv>" 
    --delimiter=,


The command line utility using python is - "dbCli.py"

# It seems that the "name" property of the "Category" nodes is frequently used
 for matching. I created an index on the "name" property to speed up the search operations.

# I used the python time module to monitor the query execution time
